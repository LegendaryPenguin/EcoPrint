# What is EcoPrint 
A blockchain-powered marketplace where businesses can trade verified carbon credits transparently, leveraging IPFS and real-time climate insights to ensure trust and impact!

# Inspiration 
With the rise of global warming, climate change restrictions are increasing worldwide. A carbon credit cap-and-trade system is an inevitable step toward reducing industrial emissions with international organizations like the CPLC (Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition) advocating for a switch. In this sort of system, businesses would have to purchase carbon credits from the government to offset their emissions. Our idea was to create a middleman service that could leverage blockchain, decentralized storage, and AI-driven verification to create a trustless, transparent marketplace. The vision for this marketplace is a place where businesses can buy verified carbon credits, governments can ensure compliance, and environmental impact is measurable and immutable.

# What it Does
Our system acts as a middleman service in the cap-and-trade carbon credit market, to ensure trust, transparency, and impact verification through blockchain technology. Businesses can:
Buy and sell verified carbon credits directly from the government or other entities which is processed on our custom Carbon Chain.
Store carbon credit transactions on IPFS via Pinata to ensure permanence and accessibility.
Use group key validation to allow government agencies to verify transaction authenticity using their public key.
Analyze the real impact of carbon credit usage through Autonomy’s network using AI climate analysis.
Eliminate fraudulent carbon credit transactions through our system of signing using the entity private key and government private key (group key validation) to ensure only valid credits are traded.

# Components 
**Custom Blockchain for Transactions**
We built a custom blockchain to handle carbon credit transactions, ensuring immutability and transparency.
Each transaction is structured using Merkle trees to allow for efficient verification and fraud prevention.

**Why Pinata?**
Pinata enables decentralized storage for carbon credit records, ensuring permanence and tamper resistance.
Group key validation allows governments to retrieve and verify stored credit data while maintaining decentralization.
Unlike traditional centralized databases, IPFS prevents data loss, manipulation, and unauthorized changes, making it the ideal solution for long-term, verifiable records.

**Why Autonomys?**
Autonomys leverages AI to analyze carbon credit transactions from ever changing carbon credits exchange data and predict real-world climate impact .
By taking snapshots of transaction data, it ensures unstoppable data availability which makes it impossible for bad actors to erase or manipulate climate impact records.
This feature provides a real-time data-driven approach to climate accountability which can help regulators and businesses understand the effectiveness of carbon offset initiatives while consumers can see a verified record of each entity’s carbon footprint.

# Future Recommendations
There are many ways this idea can be expanded upon and improved in the future!
1. Smart Contract based Automated Compliance
2. ZK Proof based Transaction Privacy
3. Integrate Smart Contracts for Automated Compliance
4. Utilize machine learning to forecast emissions trennds
5. Develop a CAO to allow community driven decision making
